We need to have the duration as just numbers without the word mins so we can do some statistical analysis on the movies durations. Use the pandas function `str.split` to split the runtime column into two (number and the word mins). Then add the one that has the numbers to the data as a new column called duration. For example, the rows that had runtime 142 mins, will have a new column called duration which contains 142"
